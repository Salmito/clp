{"name":"Clp","tagline":"Comunicating Lua Processes","body":"# Communicating Lua Processes\r\nCLP is a Lua library for bulding lightweight parallel processes based on the concepts of CSP (Communicating Sequential Processes).\r\n\r\n## Compiling and Installing\r\nCLP is compatible with almost every Lua interpreter: it has been tested with PUC-Rio's Lua version 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 alpha.\r\n\r\nIt was also tested with other  Lua interpreters such as Luajit, love2d and torch.\r\n\r\nCurrently, CLP requires Threading Building Blocks (TBB) and Libevent libraries to work properly.\r\n\r\nFor more information on the TBB library: http://threadingbuildingblocks.org/\r\n\r\nFor more information on the Libevent library: http://libevent.org/\r\n\r\nIf you want to try it out on windows, just clone the https://github.com/Salmito/ZeroBraneStudio repository fork with the CLP binary preinstalled.\r\n\r\nTo install all dependencies for Lua 5.1 on a Debian like linux (Ubuntu, mint, etc) do: \r\n```\r\nsudo apt-get install libtbb-dev libevent-dev lua5.1-dev lua5.1\r\n```\r\n\r\nEquivalently, to install dependencies for Lua 5.2 on a Debian like linux (Ubuntu, mint, etc) do: \r\n```\r\nsudo apt-get install libtbb-dev libevent-dev lua5.2-dev lua5.2\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo build and install CLP for Lua 5.1:\r\n```\r\n   $ make\r\n   $ sudo make install\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo build and install CLP for Lua 5.2:\r\n```\r\n   $ make LUA_VER=5.2\r\n   $ sudo make install LUA_VER=5.2\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo uninstall CLP on Lua 5.1:\r\n```\r\n   $ sudo make uninstall\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo uninstall CLP on Lua 5.2:\r\n```\r\n   $ sudo make uninstall LUA_VER=5.2\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Testing installation\r\nTo test if the installation was successful type this command:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ lua -l clp\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou should get the lua prompt if clp was installed properly or the error message \"module 'clp' not found\"  if it cannot be loaded (check if it was installed on a wrong location).\r\n\r\nThen, run the scripts in the test directory to validate the installation.\r\n\r\nThat's it.\r\n\r\n## Reporting BUGS\r\nIf you find bugs, please report them on GitHub: https://github.com/Salmito/clp/issues\r\n\r\nOr e-mail me: Tiago Salmito - tiago _[at]_ salmito _[dot]_ com\r\n\r\n## Copyright notice\r\nCLP is published under the same MIT license as Lua 5.1.\r\n\r\nCopyright (C) 2014 Tiago Salmito\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\r\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
